# Data Visualisations Coursework

## 1. Overview - Tasks
* For the assignment we had to analyze a given dataset that has been cleaned and is ready to be investigated so we could gather more information from it. 
* For our task we had to be able to identify Outliers successfully and to be able to see any patterns/relationship between the data that might be interesting to show to a group of people. 
* Another task is to display the Visualisations appropriately for the given data that we have analyzed. 
* Another task was to choose our colors and shapes correctly so it is suitable for all people
* Last task is to identify any issues with the visualisation provided and to try and improve it.

## 3. Code to get visualisations
* The code that has helped me identify the given tasks is in file coursework.R 
* I have tried different kinds of combinations until I can see clearly what I have been looking for. 
* As soon as I see anything that could be a pattern I investigate it further by trying to dig deeper into the relationship.

## 4. Visualisations 
For the visualisations ggplot2 was used together with library(scales) which is The viridis color palettes (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) in order to prevent issues for people that are color-blind (any type)
